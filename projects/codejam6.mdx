<Section title="Rex-Explorer: A Journey Back in Time" id="Rex-Explorer"/>

Rex-Explorer was conceived and developed over a week for CodeJam VI, by Team Inquisitive Investigators (f1re & Monika). This project is a nod to the retro computing era, bringing back the simplicity and nostalgia of navigating through files and directories using a text-based user interface (TUI).

**Features:**

- **Retro File Browsing**: Dive into the past with a TUI that lets you explore your files and directories in a way that modern GUIs can't replicate.
- **Integrated Terminal**: More than just file browsingâ€”execute commands, change directories, and even push commits to GitHub directly from Rex-Explorer.
- **Text Editor**: Why stop at browsing? Edit your files right within Rex-Explorer, experiencing text manipulation as it was in the early days of computing.
- **Photo Viewer**: A last-minute addition that turned out to be invaluable, allowing users to view images directly within the TUI environment.
- **File and Directory Management**: Create, rename, and copy files and directories, all within the same unified interface.

Achieving third place in the competition, Rex-Explorer was recognized for its comprehensive feature set, combining a file explorer, terminal, text editor, and photo viewer into a single, easy-to-use application.
